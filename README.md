This project is a comprehensive online version of tetris that implements user accounts and an online connection to display a leaderboard for competition.
APIs utilized: esm, jQuery, Axios, keypress (to test in console).  Each serves a different purpose in front-end or back-end operations.
How to play:
Move the incoming block with the WASD keys on your keyboard to align with other blocks on the screen. Rotate the block with the left and right arrow keys. Upon creating an entire row, it will be eliminated and free up more space. The objective is to eliminate the most blocks and keep the game going as long as possible.
